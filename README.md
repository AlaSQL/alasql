# AlaSQL

<h2 align="center"><a href="http://alasql.org"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1063454/19309516/94f8007e-9085-11e6-810f-62fd60b42185.png" alt="AlaSQL logo" styl="max-width:80%"/></a>
</h2>



AlaSQL - _( [à la](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%A0_la) [SQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) ) [ælæ ɛskju:ɛl]_ - is an open source SQL database for JavaScript with a strong focus on query speed and data source flexibility for both relational data and schemaless data.  It works in the web browser, Node.js, and mobile apps.

This library is designed for:

* Fast in-memory SQL data processing for BI and ERP applications on fat clients
* Easy ETL and options for persistence by data import / manipulation / export of several formats
* All major browsers, Node.js, and mobile applications

We focus on [speed](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/Speed) by taking advantage of the dynamic nature of JavaScript when building up queries. Real-world solutions demand flexibility regarding where data comes from and where it is to be stored. We focus on flexibility by making sure you can [import/export](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/Import-export) and query directly on data stored in Excel (both `.xls` and `.xlsx`), CSV, JSON, TAB, IndexedDB, LocalStorage, and SQLite files.

The library adds the comfort of a full database engine to your JavaScript app. No, really - it's working towards a full database engine complying with [most of the SQL-99 language](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/Supported-SQL-statements), spiced up with additional syntax for NoSQL (schema-less) data and graph networks.


#### Traditional SQL Table

```js
/* create SQL Table and add data */
alasql("CREATE TABLE cities (city string, pop number)");

alasql("INSERT INTO cities VALUES ('Paris',2249975),('Berlin',3517424),('Madrid',3041579)");

/* execute query */
var res = alasql("SELECT * FROM cities WHERE pop < 3500000 ORDER BY pop DESC");

// res = [ { "city": "Madrid", "pop": 3041579 }, { "city": "Paris", "pop": 2249975 } ]
```

[Live Demo](https://jsfiddle.net/jqk80ard/)

#### Array of Objects

```js
var data = [ {a: 1, b: 10}, {a: 2, b: 20}, {a: 1, b: 30} ];

var res = alasql('SELECT a, SUM(b) AS b FROM ? GROUP BY a',[data]);

// res = [ { "a": 1, "b": 40},{ "a": 2, "b": 20 } ]
```

[Live Demo](https://jsfiddle.net/8brvex4f/)

#### Spreadsheet

```js
// file is read asynchronously (Promise returned when SQL given as array)
alasql(['SELECT * FROM XLS("./data/mydata") WHERE lastname LIKE "A%" and city = "London" GROUP BY name '])
    .then(function(res){
        console.log(res); // output depends on mydata.xls
    }).catch(function(err){
        console.log('Does the file exist? There was an error:', err);
    });
```


#### Bulk Data Load

```js
alasql("CREATE TABLE example1 (a INT, b INT)");

// alasql's data store for a table can be assigned directly
alasql.tables.example1.data = [
    {a:2,b:6},
    {a:3,b:4}
];

// ... or manipulated with normal SQL
alasql("INSERT INTO example1 VALUES (1,5)");

var res = alasql("SELECT * FROM example1 ORDER BY b DESC");

console.log(res); // [{a:2,b:6},{a:1,b:5},{a:3,b:4}]
```


__If you are familiar with SQL it should come as no surprise that proper use of indexes on your tables is essential to get good performance.__

## Please note

**All contributions are extremely welcome and greatly appreciated(!)** -
The project has never received any funding and is based on unpaid voluntary work: [We really (really) love pull requests](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)

The AlaSQL project depends on your contribution of code and <s>may</s> have [bugs](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/labels/%21%20Bug). So please, submit any bugs and suggestions [as an issue](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/issues/new).

Please check out the [limitations of the library](https://github.com/alasql/alasql#limitations).

## Performance

AlaSQL is designed for speed and includes some of the classic SQL engine optimizations:

* Queries are cached as compiled functions
* Joined tables are pre-indexed
* `WHERE` expressions are pre-filtered for joins

See more [performance-related info on the wiki](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/Speed)

## Features you might like


### Traditional SQL

Use "good old" SQL on your data with multiple levels of: `JOIN`, `VIEW`, `GROUP BY`, `UNION`, `PRIMARY KEY`, `ANY`, `ALL`, `IN`, `ROLLUP()`, `CUBE()`, `GROUPING SETS()`, `CROSS APPLY`, `OUTER APPLY`, `WITH SELECT`, and subqueries. [The wiki lists supported SQL statements and keywords](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/SQL%20keywords).



### User-Defined Functions in your SQL

You can use all benefits of SQL and JavaScript together by defining your own custom functions. Just add new functions to the alasql.fn object:


```js
alasql.fn.myfn = function(a,b) {
    return a*b+1;
};
var res = alasql('SELECT myfn(a,b) FROM one');
```

You can also define your own aggregator functions (like your own `SUM(...)`). See more [in the wiki](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/User-Defined-Functions)


### Compiled statements and functions

```js
var ins = alasql.compile('INSERT INTO one VALUES (?,?)');
ins(1,10);
ins(2,20);
```

See more [in the wiki](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/Compile)


### SELECT against your JavaScript data

Group your JavaScript array of objects by field and count number of records in each group:

```js
var data = [{a:1,b:1,c:1},{a:1,b:2,c:1},{a:1,b:3,c:1}, {a:2,b:1,c:1}];
var res = alasql('SELECT a, COUNT(*) AS b FROM ? GROUP BY a', [data] );
```

See more ideas for creative data manipulation [in the wiki](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/Getting-started)



### JavaScript Sugar

AlaSQL extends "good old" SQL to make it closer to JavaScript. The "sugar" includes:

* Write Json objects - `{a:'1',b:@['1','2','3']}`

* Access object properties - `obj->property->subproperty`
* Access object and arrays elements - `obj->(a*1)`
* Access JavaScript functions - `obj->valueOf()`
* Format query output with `SELECT VALUE, ROW, COLUMN, MATRIX`
* ES5 multiline SQL with `var SQL = function(){/*SELECT 'MY MULTILINE SQL'*/}` and pass instead of SQL string (will not work if you compress your code)


### Read and write Excel and raw data files

You can import from and export to CSV, TAB, TXT, and JSON files. File extensions can be omitted. Calls to files will always be asynchronous so multi-file queries should be chained:

```js
var tabFile = 'mydata.tab';

alasql.promise([
    "SELECT * FROM txt('MyFile.log') WHERE [0] LIKE 'M%'", // parameter-less query
    [ "SELECT * FROM tab(?) ORDER BY [1]", [tabFile] ],    // [query, array of params]
    "SELECT [3] AS city,[4] AS population FROM csv('./data/cities')",
    "SELECT * FROM json('../config/myJsonfile')"
]).then(function(results){
    console.log(results);
}).catch(console.error);
```


### Read SQLite database files

AlaSQL can read (but not write) SQLite data files using [SQL.js](https://github.com/kripken/sql.js) library:

```html
<script src="alasql.js"></script>
<script src="sql.js"></script>
<script>
    alasql([
        'ATTACH SQLITE DATABASE Chinook("Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite")',
        'USE Chinook',
        'SELECT * FROM Genre'
    ]).then(function(res){
        console.log("Genres:",res.pop());
    });
</script>
```

`sql.js` calls will always be asynchronous.


### AlaSQL works in the console - CLI

The node module ships with an `alasql` command-line tool:

```bash
$ npm install -g alasql ## install the module globally

$ alasql -h ## shows usage information

$ alasql "SET @data = @[{a:'1',b:?},{a:'2',b:?}]; SELECT a, b FROM @data;" 10 20
[ 1, [ { a: 1, b: 10 }, { a: 2, b: 20 } ] ]

$ alasql "VALUE OF SELECT COUNT(*) AS abc FROM TXT('README.md') WHERE LENGTH([0]) > ?" 140
// Number of lines with more than 140 characters in README.md
```

[More examples are included in the wiki](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/AlaSQL-CLI)


## Features you might love

### AlaSQL ♥ D3.js

AlaSQL plays nice with d3.js and gives you a convenient way to integrate a specific subset of your data with the visual powers of D3. See more about [D3.js and AlaSQL in the wiki](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/d3.js)

### AlaSQL ♥ Excel

AlaSQL can export data to both [Excel 2003 (.xls)](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/XLS) and [Excel 2007 (.xlsx)](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/XLSX) formats with coloring of cells and other Excel formatting functions.

### AlaSQL ♥ Meteor

Meteor is amazing. You can query directly on your Meteor collections with SQL - simple and easy. See more about [Meteor and AlaSQL in the wiki](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/Meteor)

### AlaSQL ♥ Angular.js

Angular is great. In addition to normal data manipulation, AlaSQL works like a charm for exporting your present scope to Excel. See more about [Angular and AlaSQL in the wiki](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/Angular.js)

### AlaSQL ♥ Google Maps

Pinpointing data on a map should be easy. AlaSQL is great to prepare source data for Google Maps from, for example, Excel or CSV, making it one unit of work for fetching and identifying what's relevant. See more about [Google Maps and AlaSQL in the wiki](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/Google-maps)

### AlaSQL ♥ Google Spreadsheets

AlaSQL can query data directly from a Google spreadsheet. A good "partnership" for easy editing and powerful data manipulation. See more about [Google Spreadsheets and AlaSQL in the wiki](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/Google-Spreadsheets)

## Limitations

Please be aware that AlaSQL has [bugs](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/labels/Bug). Beside having some bugs, there are a number of limitations:

0. AlaSQL has a (long) list of keywords that must be escaped if used for column names. When selecting a field named `key` please write ``` SELECT `key` FROM ... ``` instead. This is also the case for words like ``` `value` ```, ``` `read` ```, ``` `count` ```, ``` `by` ```, ``` `top` ```, ``` `path` ```, ``` `deleted` ```, ``` `work` ``` and ``` `offset` ```. Please consult the [full list of keywords](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/AlaSQL-Keywords).

0. It is OK to `SELECT` 1000000 records or to `JOIN` two tables with 10000 records in each (You can use streaming functions to work with longer datasources - see [test/test143.js](test/test143.js)) but be aware that the workload is multiplied so `SELECT`ing from more than 8 tables with just 100 rows in each will show bad performance. This is one of our top priorities to make better.

0. Limited functionality for transactions (supports only for localStorage) - Sorry, transactions are limited, because AlaSQL switched to more complex approach for handling `PRIMARY KEY`s / `FOREIGN KEY`s. Transactions will be fully turned on again in a future version.

0. A `(FULL) OUTER JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN` of more than 2 tables will not produce expected results. `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` are OK.

0. Please use aliases when you want fields with the same name from different tables (`SELECT a.id AS a_id, b.id AS b_id FROM ?`).

0. At the moment AlaSQL does not work with JSZip 3.0.0 - please use version 2.x.

0. `JOIN`ing a sub-`SELECT` does not work. Please use a `with` structure ([Example here](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/issues/832#issuecomment-377574550)) or fetch the sub-`SELECT` to a variable and pass it as an argument ([Example here](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/issues/832#issuecomment-377559478)).

0. AlaSQL uses the [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/) library for saving files locally from the browser. Please be aware that it does not save files in Safari 8.0.

There are probably many others. Please help us fix them by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/issues). Thank you!


## How To

### Use AlaSQL to convert data from CSV to Excel

ETL example:

```js
alasql([
    'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS geo.country',
    'SELECT * INTO geo.country FROM CSV("country.csv",{headers:true})',
    'SELECT * INTO XLSX("asia") FROM geo.country WHERE continent_name = "Asia"'
]).then(function(res){
    // results from the file asia.xlsx
});
```

### Use AlaSQL as a Web Worker

AlaSQL can run in a Web Worker. Please be aware that all interaction with AlaSQL when running must be async.

From the browser thread, the browser build `alasql-worker.min.js` automagically uses Web Workers:

```html
<script src="alasql-worker.min.js"></script>
<script>
var arr = [{a:1},{a:2},{a:1}];

alasql([['SELECT * FROM ?',[arr]]]).then(function(data){
    console.log(data);
});
</script>
```

[Live Demo](https://jsfiddle.net/3vnmu2fo).

The standard build `alasql.min.js` will use Web Workers if `alasql.worker()` is called:

```html
<script src="alasql.min.js"></script>
<script>
alasql.worker();
alasql(['SELECT VALUE 10']).then(function(res){
    console.log(res);
}).catch(console.error);
</script>
```

[Live Demo](http://jsfiddle.net/osxvdp5k/).

From a Web Worker, you can import `alasql.min.js` with `importScripts`:

```js
importScripts('alasql.min.js');
```

### Webpack, Browserify, Vue and React (Native)

When targeting the browser, several code bundlers like Webpack and Browserify will pick up modules you might not want.

Here's a list of modules that AlaSQL may require in certain environments or for certain features:

* Node.js
  * fs
  * net
  * tls
  * request
  * path
* React Native
  * react-native
  * react-native-fs
  * react-native-fetch-blob
* Vertx
  * vertx
* Agonostic
  * XLSX/XLS support
    * cptable
    * jszip
    * xlsx
    * cpexcel
  * es6-promise

#### Webpack

There are several ways to handle AlaSQL with Webpack:

##### IgnorePlugin

Ideal when you want to control which modules you want to import.

```js
var IgnorePlugin =  require("webpack").IgnorePlugin;

module.exports = {
  ...
  // Will ignore the modules fs, path, xlsx, request, vertx, and react-native modules
  plugins:[new IgnorePlugin(/(^fs$|cptable|jszip|xlsx|^es6-promise$|^net$|^tls$|^forever-agent$|^tough-cookie$|cpexcel|^path$|^request$|react-native|^vertx$)/)]
};
```

##### module.noParse

As of AlaSQL 0.3.5, you can simply tell Webpack not to parse AlaSQL, which avoids all the dynamic `require` warnings and avoids using `eval`/clashing with CSP with script-loader.
[Read the Webpack docs about noParse](https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#module-noparse)

```js
...
//Don't parse alasql
{module:noParse:[/alasql/]}
```


##### script-loader

If both of the solutions above fail to meet your requirements, you can load AlaSQL with [script-loader](https://github.com/webpack/script-loader).

```js
//Load alasql in the global scope with script-loader
import "script!alasql"
```

This can cause issues if you have a CSP that doesn't allow `eval`.

#### Browserify

Read up on [excluding](https://github.com/substack/browserify-handbook#excluding), [ignoring](https://github.com/substack/browserify-handbook#ignoring), and [shimming](https://github.com/substack/browserify-handbook#shimming)

Example (using excluding)

```js
var browserify = require("browserify");
var b = browserify("./main.js").bundle();
//Will ignore the modules fs, path, xlsx
["fs","path","xlsx",  ... ].forEach(ignore => { b.ignore(ignore) });
```

#### Vue

For some frameworks (lige Vue) alasql cant access XLSX by it self. We recommend handling it by including AlaSQL the following way:

```import alasql from 'alasql';
import XLSX from 'xlsx';
alasql.utils.isBrowserify = false;
alasql.utils.global.XLSX = XLSX;
```

#### jQuery

Please remember to send the original event, and not the jQuery event, for elements. (Use `event.originalEvent` instead of `myEvent`)

### JSON-object

You can use JSON objects in your databases (do not forget use == and !== operators for deep comparison of objects):

```sql

alasql> SELECT VALUE {a:'1',b:'2'}

{a:1,b:2}

alasql> SELECT VALUE {a:'1',b:'2'} == {a:'1',b:'2'}

true

alasql> SELECT VALUE {a:'1',b:'2'}->b

2

alasql> SELECT VALUE {a:'1',b:(2*2)}->b

4

```

Try AlaSQL JSON objects in Console [sample](http://alasql.org/console?drop table if exists one;create table one;insert into one values {a:@[1,2,3],c:{e:23}}, {a:@[{b:@[1,2,3]}]};select * from one)


## Experimental

_Useful stuff, but there might be dragons_

### Graphs

AlaSQL is a multi-paradigm database with support for graphs that can be searched or manipulated.

```js
// Who loves lovers of Alice?
var res = alasql('SEARCH / ANY(>> >> #Alice) name');
console.log(res) // ['Olga','Helen']
```

See more [in the wiki](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/GRAPH)

### localStorage and DOM-storage

You can use browser localStorage and [DOM-storage](https://github.com/node-browser-compat/dom-storage) as a data storage. Here is a sample:

```js
alasql('CREATE localStorage DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS Atlas');
alasql('ATTACH localStorage DATABASE Atlas AS MyAtlas');
alasql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS MyAtlas.City (city string, population number)');
alasql('SELECT * INTO MyAtlas.City FROM ?',[ [
        {city:'Vienna', population:1731000},
        {city:'Budapest', population:1728000}
] ]);
var res = alasql('SELECT * FROM MyAtlas.City');
```

Try this sample in [jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/agershun/x1gq3wf2/). Run this sample
two or three times, and AlaSQL store more and more data in localStorage. Here, "Atlas" is
the name of localStorage database, where "MyAtlas" is a memory AlaSQL database.

You can use localStorage in two modes: `SET AUTOCOMMIT ON` to immediate save data
to localStorage after each statement or `SET AUTOCOMMIT OFF`. In this case, you need
to use `COMMIT` statement to save all data from in-memory mirror to localStorage.

### Plugins

AlaSQL supports plugins. To install a plugin you need to use the `REQUIRE` statement. See more [in the wiki](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/Plugins)

### Alaserver - simple database server

Yes, you can even use AlaSQL as a very simple server for tests.

To run enter the command:

```bash
$ alaserver
```

then open <http://127.0.0.1:1337/?SELECT%20VALUE%20(2*2)> in your browser

Warning: Alaserver is not multi-threaded, not concurrent, and not secured.


## Tests

### Regression tests

AlaSQL currently has over 1200 regression tests, but they only cover [![Coverage]( https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/alasql/alasql/develop.svg)](https://rawgit.com/alasql/alasql/develop/test/coverage/lcov-report/dist/alasql.fs.js.html)
of the codebase.

AlaSQL uses `mocha` for regression tests. Install `mocha` and run

```bash
$ npm test
```

or open [test/index.html](test/index.html) for in-browser tests (Please serve via localhost with, for example, `http-server`).

#### Tests with AlaSQL ASSERT from SQL

You can use AlaSQL's [ASSERT](wiki/Assert) operator to test the results of previous operation:

```sql
CREATE TABLE one (a INT);             ASSERT 1;
INSERT INTO one VALUES (1),(2),(3);   ASSERT 3;
SELECT * FROM one ORDER BY a DESC;    ASSERT [{a:3},{a:2},{a:1}];
```

#### SQLLOGICTEST

AlaSQL uses `SQLLOGICTEST` to test its compatibility with SQL-99. The tests include about 2 million queries and statements.

The testruns can be found in the [testlog](TESTLOG.md).
