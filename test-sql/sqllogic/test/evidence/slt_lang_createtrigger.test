# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-49475-10767 Triggers are database operations that are

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-52227-24890 At this time SQLite supports only FOR EACH
# ROW triggers, not FOR EACH STATEMENT triggers.

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-38336-05023 Hence explicitly specifying FOR EACH ROW is
# optional.

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-32235-53300 FOR EACH ROW implies that the SQL
# statements specified in the trigger may be executed (depending on the
# WHEN clause) for each database row being inserted, updated or deleted
# by the statement causing the trigger to fire.

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-25950-00887 Both the WHEN clause and the trigger
# actions may access elements of the row being inserted, deleted or
# updated using references of the form "NEW.column-name" and
# "OLD.column-name", where column-name is the name of a column from the
# table that the trigger is associated with.

# EVIDENCE-OF: R-63660-13730 OLD and NEW references may only be used in
# triggers on events for which they are relevant, as follows: INSERT NEW
# references are valid UPDATE NEW and OLD references are valid DELETE
# OLD references are valid

# EVIDENCE-OF: R-17846-38304 If a WHEN clause is supplied, the SQL
# statements specified are only executed for rows for which the WHEN
# clause is true.

# EVIDENCE-OF: R-20446-37715 If no WHEN clause is supplied, the SQL
# statements are executed for all rows.

# EVIDENCE-OF: R-35362-38850 The BEFORE or AFTER keyword determines when
# the trigger actions will be executed relative to the insertion,
# modification or removal of the associated row.

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-57724-61571 An ON CONFLICT clause may be specified as
# part of an UPDATE or INSERT action within the body of the trigger.

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-35856-58769 However if an ON CONFLICT clause is
# specified as part of the statement causing the trigger to fire, then
# conflict handling policy of the outer statement is used instead.

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-32333-58476 Triggers are automatically dropped when the
# table that they are associated with (the table-name table) is dropped.

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-45164-23268 However if the trigger actions reference
# other tables, the trigger is not dropped or modified if those other
# tables are dropped or modified.

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-31067-37494 Triggers are removed using the DROP TRIGGER
# statement.

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-46291-22228 The UPDATE, DELETE, and INSERT statements
# within triggers do not support the full syntax for UPDATE, DELETE, and
# INSERT statements.

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-42881-44982 The name of the table to be modified in an
# UPDATE, DELETE, or INSERT statement must be an unqualified table name.
# In other words, one must use just "tablename" not "database.tablename"
# when specifying the table.

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-58089-32183 The table to be modified must exist in the
# same database as the table or view to which the trigger is attached.

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-21148-64834 The "INSERT INTO table DEFAULT VALUES" form
# of the INSERT statement is not supported.

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-34918-27009 The INDEXED BY and NOT INDEXED clauses are
# not supported for UPDATE and DELETE statements.

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-43310-35438 The ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses on UPDATE
# and DELETE statements are not supported. ORDER BY and LIMIT are not
# normally supported for UPDATE or DELETE in any context but can be
# enabled for top-level statements using the
# SQLITE_ENABLE_UPDATE_DELETE_LIMIT compile-time option. However, that
# compile-time option only applies to top-level UPDATE and DELETE
# statements, not UPDATE and DELETE statements within triggers.

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-63298-27030 Triggers may be created on views, as well
# as ordinary tables, by specifying INSTEAD OF in the CREATE TRIGGER
# statement.

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-36338-64112 If one or more ON INSERT, ON DELETE or ON
# UPDATE triggers are defined on a view, then it is not an error to
# execute an INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE statement on the view,
# respectively.

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-46991-00459 Instead, executing an INSERT, DELETE or
# UPDATE on the view causes the associated triggers to fire.

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-42811-40895 The real tables underlying the view are not
# modified (except possibly explicitly, by a trigger program).

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-58080-31767 Note that the sqlite3_changes() and
# sqlite3_total_changes() interfaces do not count INSTEAD OF trigger
# firings, but the count_changes pragma does count INSTEAD OF trigger
# firing.

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-60230-33797 Assuming that customer records are stored
# in the "customers" table, and that order records are stored in the
# "orders" table, the following trigger ensures that all associated
# orders are redirected when a customer changes his or her address:
# CREATE TRIGGER update_customer_address UPDATE OF address ON customers
# BEGIN UPDATE orders SET address = new.address WHERE customer_name =
# old.name; END; With this trigger installed, executing the statement:
# UPDATE customers SET address = '1 Main St.' WHERE name = 'Jack Jones';
# causes the following to be automatically executed: UPDATE orders SET
# address = '1 Main St.' WHERE customer_name = 'Jack Jones';

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-53099-14426 A special SQL function RAISE() may be used
# within a trigger-program,

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-17798-50697 When one of the first three forms is called
# during trigger-program execution, the specified ON CONFLICT processing
# is performed (either ABORT, FAIL or ROLLBACK) and the current query
# terminates.

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-48669-35999 When RAISE(IGNORE) is called, the remainder
# of the current trigger program, the statement that caused the trigger
# program to execute and any subsequent trigger programs that would of
# been executed are abandoned.

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-64082-04685 No database changes are rolled back.

# TBD-EVIDENCE-OF: R-01402-03601 If the statement that caused the trigger
# program to execute is itself part of a trigger program, then that
# trigger program resumes execution at the beginning of the next step.
